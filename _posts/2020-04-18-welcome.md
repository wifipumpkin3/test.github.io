## Introduction 

**Wp3** is out! I am finally ready to publish first version of **wifipumpkin3**. This version is full **python 3** and CLI (command line interface), but require as dependency Pyqt5 because a i reused many code and implementation of structure the WiFiPumpkin GUI. 

<!--more-->

I'm really surprised how the project evolved in less than **2 months**, because i had many obstacles to developlement like `DHCP server`, `DNS server`, `hostapd threaded` and more. ok, let's go to what matters!

## Features

This frist release has been prioritized the **core** to working fine. it great, because the core is fundamental to awsome work in any environment. but the features are matter, frist has been added DNS Server now monitor all request query sended by client connected the AP, it great feature for **pentests and bugbountys** do a dynamic analysis of comunication client-side. look the anothers features.

- Rogue access point attack
- Man-in-the-middle attack
- Rouge **Dns Server**
- Captive portal attack (captiveflask)
- **Intercept**, inspect, modify and replay **web traffic**
- **WiFi** networks scanning
- **DNS** monitoring service
- Credentials harvesting
- Transparent Proxies
- LLMNR, NBT-NS and MDNS poisoner ([Responder3](https://github.com/skelsec/Responder3)) 
- and **more**!

## Works on Docker container

I have to admit, this feature was wanted in the GUI version for a long time. with the APP running in a container, many environmental installation problems are solved, even more so that it facilitates the installation of the tool.

## Future 

I have a lot of ideas I want implemented into **Wifipumpkin3**. At the moment, I am really aware of what I have to prioritize now, but I see great potential in future versions, since I have a large TODO list to implement them. 

### The End

I'd really like to see how you, the red teamers and security researcher plan to use this tool and how it can aid you in managing your Man-in-the-middle attack. 

Expect future updates. Enjoy and I'm waiting for your feedback!
